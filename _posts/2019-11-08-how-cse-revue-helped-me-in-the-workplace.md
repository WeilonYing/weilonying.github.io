*A few days ago, I was asked how doing CSE Revue helped me in the workplace. I decided to expand upon my answer here.*

CSE (Computer Science & Engineering) Revue was a student society I was involved with during my time at 
the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia. 
The society puts on a revue - a comedy sketch show with singing, acting, and dancing - every year with
a slight flavour of computer science. CComing into uni at the start of 2015, the idea of acting, being obnoxiously loud
and rehearsing for 6 hours a day for the show was something that I wouldn't even consider doing. But then, in June 2015,
I was peer-pressured into auditioning for revue, and I proceeded to perform for CSE Revue in 2015, 2016
and 2018.

People have asked me how am I insane enough to disappear for a semester and risk my grades for a show
that had no apparent positive effect on my grades. I was asked why I would put in so much work into
a show that I didn't even get paid to do, or use that time I invested into getting a job that did pay.
And the answer is that I thought this was something I needed to do. Something to force myself out of
my shell and involve myself in an act that I normally wouldn't do.

And it turned out that the ability to do this was far more useful than a few good grades. 

The ability to leave my own comfort zone and do something I normally would not do opens up new
opportunities. You literally open new opportunities for yourself simply by saying "HELL YEAH"
instead of "no". You naturally pick up skills that you might not have come across otherwise.
You end up trying to do things that seem impossible, and every now and then, you succeed
anyway and reap the rewards. 

And in terms of practical skills, in the workplace, coding is only about 30-50% of the work you do as a software engineer.
Many people don't realise that a large portion of the job involves working with a variety of people 
with different personalities and backgrounds. I often need to communicate with the rest of my engineering team, 
and doing this clearly and effectively is vital in making sure our work gets done correctly.

CSE Revue cast has definitely helped me in this aspect. The experience has taught me how to conduct 
myself confidently, and more importantly, how to speak clearly and audibly despite having a minor speech 
impediment. It has made me unafraid of trying new experiences, and the prospect of meeting and working 
with unfamiliar people is definitely less daunting after having done this experience for three years.
