# What to do if you miss a flight
*Or a story of how I blew $160 USD on a single Uber trip.*

It happens to the best of us. Maybe you forgot your passport. Maybe you lost track of time. Maybe airport security held you up. In my case, it was the Bay Area traffic.

Last Friday, I was meant to board a Southwest flight to Seattle from San Jose at 6:05pm. I finished up work in Menlo Park at 4:20pm, aiming to catch an Uber to arrive at San Jose airport at 5:10pm. What happened instead was a total traffic nightmare, where my Uber took 20 minutes to arrive even though it was only 2 kilometres away and another 20 minutes to get onto the freeway.

Not gonna lie. I started panicking and stressing out when it became obvious that I was going to miss my flight. But eventually I managed to calm myself down and figured I should call Southwest to see what they could do.

The good news was that after figuring out to get to a human customer support representative, they managed to put me onto a later flight at 10pm. The bad news was that the flight departed from Oakland airport, which was on the *other side* of the Bay Area. By the time the rebooking was finished, my Uber was almost at San Jose. The $40 trip from Menlo Park to San Jose ended up being a 2 hour crawl around the bay, costing $160 USD. Fun times.

So, lessons learnt:
- Don't trust the road traffic in the Bay Area. Ever.
- Don't catch a flight departing during peak traffic hour whenever possible.
- If you do catch a flight during peak hour, aim to get to the airport with a 2 hour window. Maybe even 3 just to be safe.
- If you are going to miss your flight, call your airline as soon as that becomes evident. If your airline is nice enough, they'll rebook you into the next available flight.
