*Cabin fever. Yay!*  

Just under a year ago, I shared a [post](https://blog.whale.moe/living/2019/06/05/a-day-in-the-life-of-me-june-2019.html) 
detailing a typical day in my life as a software engineer. It goes without saying that such a day in my life is no 
longer as typical, with the COVID-19 pandemic forcing most people in the SF Bay Area to stay at home and wait it out.

I guess this means an update is in order. Here it is.

# A day in the life of me (May 2020)

**09:15:** My morning alarm sounds. Unless there's an early morning video call meeting, There's a 50% chance that I'll sleep through this.

**09:45:** My 2nd morning alarm sounds. There's a 50% chance I'll sleep through this. The other 50% of the time, I'll
actually get up.

**10:00:** I should be awake at this point.

**10:10:** Check my work phone for messages and updates (e.g. questions from coworkers, company anouncements). Respond to them if I need to.

**10:30:** Make breakfast. This is usually a toasted BLT sandwich and a cup of coffee, but sometimes I just go with plain cereal. 

**11:00:** Start work. My usual routine would be to check the status of my open pull requests and the current results of any
product experiment I may be running. When approved, I would merge the pull request to the master branch at around this time, so
that if anything goes wrong, I can be reached.

If there are any team meetings, they usually happen at around this time too.

**12:00:** Continue working. Currently, my work is a combination of:
- Investigating and fixing reported bugs and problems
- Working on my project which is usually a new product feature. Projects are determined and assigned to each engineer at
the start of each quarter.
- Start and/or check a product experiment, following up on anything unexpected I saw in the morning.
- Ad-hoc discussions with a coworker or two, to discuss on the implementation details of our projects.
- Reviewing other peoples' pull requests
- Mild procrastination

**15:00:** Have lunch. Most of the time I just buy lunch from a local restaurant. Otherwise I would be out of work for over an hour
doing cooking, eating and washing up.

**15:30:** Continue work, while attempting to ward off the food coma. 

**18:00:** Start wrapping up my work for the day. This might mean committing my work to version ncontrol so I can work on it
later, doing my final checks before I submit a PR for review, or checking my existing diffs to see if it's been
approved or needs more work. If it's approved, I usually wait until the next day to merge it so I'll be around in case
the code breaks Facebook.

**18:30:** Go home. Oh... right. I would do some exercise at this point. This could be going for a walk, run or stay at home
and play Beat Saber instead.

**19:30:** Take a shower. It's free time at this point, so I could be gaming, catching up with my girlfriend or working on
a side project. Maybe catch up on a show I've been meaning to watch.

**21:30:** Make and eat dinner. As you can see, my lunch and dinner times have been pushed back by ~2 hours, probably because
I've been waking and sleeping 2 hours later than before.

**22:30:** More free time.

**01:00 (next day):** Start to wind down and prepare to sleep.

**01:30-02:00:** At this point I should be sleeping. Zzzzzz...
