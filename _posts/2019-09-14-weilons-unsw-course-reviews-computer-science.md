Hello! My name is Weilon. I am a UNSW graduate with a double degree in Bachelor of Science (Computer Science)
and Bachelor of Commerce (Information Systems). I started in 2015, and graduated at the end of 2018.

I've been requested quite a few times to give a review of all the courses I've done at the
University of New South Wales (UNSW). So without further ado, here are my thoughts :)

# Weilon's UNSW course reviews (Computer Science)
The reviews are ordered by the time I've completed them from 2015 to 2018.

### COMP1917
**Computing 1**

*Now known as COMP1511 Introduction to Programming.*

I did this course in Semester 1, 2015.

COMP1917 is the introductory course to any CSE (Computer Science & Engineering) degree at UNSW,
teaching basic programming fundamentals and computer science with the C programming language.

While the course ramped up quite quickly, I found the course to be fairly doable mainly due to the
fact that I've worked with Java for about a year prior to doing this course. Those without any
programming experience may find this course hard, programming requires a specific way of
logical thinking. Speaking from personal experience, it'll take a while before you "get" it.

Keep in mind, however, that this course assumes that you have no prior programming experience. But
it is still a lot of work. Make sure you do your labs and practice programming. If you do well
in this course, you'll do well in your CSE degree.

### MATH1131
**Mathematics 1A**

I did this course in Semester 1, 2015.

The introductory mathematics course for most students in the Engineering faculty. Teaches you
calculus and algebra.
Not much to say here other than the fact that you probably should put in a bit of effort if you didn't do Mathematics Extension 2 in high school.

**Verdict**

### MATH1231
**Mathematics 1B**

I did this course in Semester 2, 2015.

The follow-up to [MATH1131 Mathematics 1A](#math1131). Not much to say
here other than the fact that you probably should prepare to do a lot of work if you didn't do
Mathematics Extension 2 in high school. Those who did do Extension 2 will probably need to put
in effort too.

### MATH1081
**Discrete Mathematics**

I did this course in Semester 2, 2015.

This maths course teaches you proofs, logical reasoning, set theory, combinatorics, binomials,
recursion and all sorts of fun logical mathematical stuff. While a general maths course, CSE
students will find that this course delves into the theoretical side of computer science.

### COMP1927
**Computing 2**

*Now known as COMP2521 Data Structures and Algorithms.*

I did this course in the Summer Semester, 2016.

The follow up to [COMP1917](#comp1917). This course delves deeper into the "science" part of
Computer Science. You'll learn about fundamental data structures (e.g. stacks and queues) and
algorithms (e.g. quicksort) that are employed everyday in real world software. You'll probably have
a easier time in this course compared to COMP1917, since you should be well acquainted with
programming by the time you do this course.

Coincidentally, the stuff you learn here is likely to be tested if you decide to interview for a
software developer/engineer role, especially for the tech giants like Google and Facebook. Do
well in this course and you'll have a solid foundation to do well in programming interviews and
land that dream engineering job 😉.

### COMP2911
**Engineering Design in Computing**

*Now known as COMP2511 Object-Oriented Design & Programming.*

I did this course in the Semester 1, 2016.

Compulsory CSE course. You'll be learning object-oriented programming (OOP) and techniques to
design and implement complex programs.

At the time, this course was notorious due to the person lecturing the course.
While the content itself was interesting and useful enough, the course was dampened by
the lack of lecture slides, the teaching quality of the lectures as well as the lecturer's perceived
disregard of feedback from the student cohort. The final exam was also criticised by many
students for the sheer amount of writing of code instead of actual examination of course content.
Being relatively slow at handwriting, this affected me particularly.

I did hear the lecturer has changed and the teaching quality is a bit better now. Teaching quality
aside, the content taught here will be very useful in the real world, and may even be asked in
technical interviews that are present in software engineer/developer roles. Microsoft is known to
test this kind of knowledge in their interviews.

### COMP3411
**Artificial Intelligence**

I did this course in the Semester 1, 2016.

This course is a general overview of Artificial Intelligence, covering several
areas of the field, including knowledge representation, machine learning and
pattern matching etc. The course also covers the applications of
AI (e.g. computer vision, speech recognition) and the social implications of AI.

First assignment is implementing several functions in Prolog. Second assignment is creating an
AI to navigate and complete a computer game.

Since it's mostly a theory-based course that gives a general overview, some people may
find it more useful to skip it and go straight to a course that covers one of these
areas in greater detail and practicality (e.g. COMP9444 Neural Networks and Deep Learning).

### COMP2041
**Software Construction: Techniques and Tools**

I did this course in the Semester 2, 2016.

This course teaches you the tools of the trade to make your software development life easier,
including version control, testing, command line tools and programming for reliability. This course
is very practical and useful, and I highly recommend this based on the fact that half of what
I did at my first internship was taught in this course.

Also the lecturer's cool.

| ☑️ | F | (if you want full marks) |

&nbsp;

*\*The lecturer in charge (Andrew Taylor) uses a tiered assignment grading system with a set of
criteria to reach each part, with each subsequent tier being exponentially harder.
You probably only need to spend a couple hours of work to get the 50% mark to pass, several hours
for credit, a few weeks of decent effort for distinction or low HD, and your entire life if you
want 100%*

### COMP3421
**Computer Graphics**

I did this course in the Semester 2, 2016.

This course teaches you the basics of rendering 2D and 3D graphics on a computer, covering the
fundamentals (e.g. polygons, perspective transformation, lighting) and the theory behind more
advanced techniques (e.g. raytracing).

The assessments are pretty challenging. But I did find the assignments fun to do once you start
to get the hang of graphics programming. The assignments involve creating your very own 2D
and 3D computer game engine.

While probably not applicable to a lot of software engineering jobs, I recommend this course simply
because I enjoyed it. Just bear in mind that the course uses matrices which is taught in [MATH1131](#math1131)
and [MATH1231](#math1231), so take some time to revise on those when you do the course.

### COMP3511
**Human Computer Interaction**

I did this course in the Semester 2, 2016.

One of the few CSE courses that has no coding at all. Some may argue that
learning about HCI isn't useful, isn't practical and is just common sense. I disagree. One of
the biggest barriers for end users is actually being able to figure out how to use your product.
This course teaches you how to make a decent UI, and I recommend it for anyone remotely interested
in frontend dev.

The group assignment is pretty fun (or grueling, if you don't like interacting with people).
You design a UI for a computer/web application, run surveys on a potential user base
and conduct user testing.

### COMP3331
**Computer Networks**

I did this course in the Semester 1, 2017. I also tutored for the course in Semester 2, 2018.

This course teaches you how computers interact each other. The course goes through most of the
network stack, from the application layer (e.g. SMTP, FTP, Bitcoin), to the transport layer
(e.g. TCP), down to the physical layer (ethernet cables). While dry at times, the stuff you learn
here is useful since you're likely to work with applications that interact with the web in the real
world.

### COMP3821
**Extended Algorithms and Programming Techniques**

Extended version of the COMP3121 Algorithms and Programming Techniques course.

I did this course in the Semester 1, 2017.

Kind of a spiritual successor to [COMP1927 (or COMP2521)](#comp1927). This course teaches you
the theory behind computational complexity, and how to implement efficient algorithms. Things
covered specifically include sorting, graphs, N/P/NP completeness problems, approximation
algorithms, Fast Fourier Transform and max flow.

No actual programming is done in the course, although you'll be writing pseudocode.

A challenging, but useful and interesting course if you want to know the theory behind
making efficient algorithms, or simply want extra ammo for your programming interviews.

### COMP2121
**Microprocessors and Interfacing**

I did this course in the Semester 2, 2017.

This course takes you into a wild discovery trip into the jungles of microprocessors, circuitry
and low level programming. We're talking barely above the metal programming here.

Along the way, you'll learn about instruction set architectures,
machine language and assembly programming, interrupts and I/O interfacing. You'll also get
a microcontroller board that you'll share with a partner to do assignments and lab homework on.

Overall, it's a challenging course, but I recommend it if you're interested in learning
how humanity managed to trick rocks into doing calculations for us.

You also might want to consider doing COMP1521 Computer System Fundamentals instead if you're
looking for something easier.

*Also please don't be an idiot like me and accidentally bring your microcontroller board to the US
 embassy*

### COMP3231
**Operating Systems**

I did this course in the Semester 1, 2018.

This course covers the fundamentals of how an operating system works, covering process management,
scheduling, synchronisation, memory management, file systems and security.

The course had three assignments where you work on a bare-bones emulated operating system (OS161).
Each assignment requires you to implement a part of the operating system, starting from
synchronisation, to file systems, and then memory management. For the second and third assignment,
you work with a partner.

Overall, this was a challenging, but essential course for becoming a well rounded software
engineer.

### COMP4920
**Management and Ethics**

I did this course in the Semester 2, 2018.

This is sort of a two-in-one course where it has a management component and an ethics
component.

The ethics portion of the course took place in the first half of the semester, and covered
the philosophy behind ethics, common ethical issues in the tech industry and applying ethics
to the workplace. Most lectures had a guest lecturer from the industry or specific expertise,
which I found were either a hit or miss.

Most of the management portion took place in the second half of the semester. This portion focused
on software project management, where we formed teams of developers to create a working application
of some significance. It mainly focuses on applying the agile methodology in implementing the project.

While I found the ethics portion straightforward, your experience of the management portion
will depend on the overall performance of your team. I also found the assessment marking of the
management portion to be inconsistent.

Nevertheless, this is a course that you'll need to do in order to get your ACS accreditation, and
I do feel is necessary especially in a time where technology is becoming ubiquitous, its
development outpaces the speed of legislation in many countries and you will almost certainly
work in a team in your professional career.
