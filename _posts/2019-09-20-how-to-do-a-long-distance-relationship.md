Yesterday, my girlfriend and I thought it would be a fun activity to each write a blog
post on what made our relationship work. So here's mine. (And here's her
[post](https://avalonche.github.io/how-to-do-a-long-distance-relationship))

I first want to preface this by saying that the things I list here are what worked for us.
Every LDR couple have their own set of unique circumstances, and you might find that what
worked for us might not work for you. **Above all**, try to keep an open mind and
communicate with your partner. Things become easier when you're both on the same page.

Somewhere ages and ages hence:
<br>
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
<br>
I took the one less traveled by,
<br>
And that has made all the difference.

About a month before I moved to the United States, I asked her to become my girlfriend.
I didn't know what I would be getting myself into. How was this relationship going to work?
How do we stay close? How do we reconcile our diverging life experiences in the future? These are
just some of the questions I've had, and continue to have.

There are many factors that make or break a romantic relationship, and long distance is simply
another factor to this. At the risk of sounding cheesy and overly idealistic, finding a fulfilling
relationship means you have to take risks with the people you want to be with. It's better to ask
and be told "no" than to never ask and spend weeks, or months wondering what could've happened.
I wanted to leave this place with no regrets.

So I asked my now-girlfriend to take the leap with me. To give this relationship a try. To take
the risk, put our heart and soul into it and see what will come out. That we'll make it work and
if we didn't, we can at least say we tried.

And so far, it is working. And I'd like to share some of the things we did that helped make this
relationship successful so far.

# Make your partner a priority
That is not to say to drop everything in your life for them. But make sure you're actively
and regularly setting time and effort for your partner so they feel like THE important person in your life
(and they are).

This is already the case for all romantic relationships, and is even more important
for long distance couples. Making your partner a priority builds trust and prevents
the anxiety that often comes with new long distance relationships.

# Do fun things together
Have some quality bonding time with your partner and do fun things together!

Just over twenty years ago, there probably weren't that many fun things to do other than
sending letters and making expensive satellite phone calls (which my parents actually did for a while).
We're a lot luckier now with the ubiquity of tech. Here's a list of some of the things we did
while we were separated:
- **Watch TV shows and movies together**. Have you and your partner download the same episodes and play them
at the same time (or stream them).
- **Voice/video calling**. We usually voice call the majority of the time since internet speed in Australia
isn't the best, and video call when circumstances allow it. There's a lot of free communication services
out there that offer voice and video calling (e.g. Facebook Messenger, Discord, WhatsApp, WeChat, LINE). Just pick
one that you and your partner use.
    - **Protip**: If either one of you suffers from constant dropouts, set up a Discord server and talk
    through a voice channel there. If your partner drops out, you don't have to set up the call
    again and vice versa!
- **Play video games together**. If you can't be together in real life just yet, be together online!
Multiplayer co-op and PvE games work best. PvP can work too if you can both keep a cool head when
the game gets frustrating. Some games that worked really well for us include:
    - Stardew Valley
    - Age of Empires 2
    - Overcooked (1 & 2)
    - Minecraft and Portal 2 are also good if both of you are familiar with the gameplay or can handle
out the learning curve.
- **Livestream yourself to your partner**. This is a relatively new one and is great if one likes
to watch the other play games. Discord [Go Live](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360030714312-Go-Live-FAQ)
is a feature that got released only two weeks ago as of the time of writing, and we've had a blast
using it to livestream one of us playing Hatoful Boyfriend to the other. You might even enjoy
watching the other write code, if you're both nerds ;)
- **Go through through questions from**
[1000 Questions For Couples](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13334810-1000-questions-for-couples) **together**.
If you and your partner can answer each question, you'll have the foundation for a good relationship.
Also recommended by many long distance couples on the internet.

# Communicate regularly
Have a sense of rhythm in how often you communicate. Some couples might talk everyday. Some only
once a week. No matter how often you talk, try to do it regularly.

If you and your partner are normally free on Saturday and Wednesday nights, schedule your calls
at those times as often as possible. If your days are unpredictable, share your schedules with each other so
the two of you will know what times are generally good for calling.

Also, call/message each other goodnight.

# Be on the same team
This is relationship advice I've received that probably applies even more for long distance couples.

The two of you have your own lives, and that means unexpected things will happen. When problems arise, remember that
your partner is your team mate, not your adversary. Work towards resolving the problem together and use language
that's indicative of that. E.g. "How should we fix this?" instead of "How are you going to fix this?".

# Visit each other
Despite all the video calling and livestreaming, distance still sucks. Visit each other as often as practically possible.
And when you're together, take the time to appreciate the normal couple-ly things that most geographically close
couples take for granted.

# Work towards closing the distance
A long distance relationship is much easier when you work with the assumption that one day, you will no
longer be separated from your partner. You don't need a detailed plan, but do have a general idea of how and
when you will close the distance with your partner.
