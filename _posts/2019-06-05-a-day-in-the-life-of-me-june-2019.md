I've been meaning to update my blog again for the past couple of weeks. But I either keep forgetting to or
I get too busy.

How did I finally get round to it? By setting a reminder on my Google Calendar, and then rescheduling it
every day until I finally got my shit together and actually write this up.

But then I had another roadblock. What should I write about?

I mentioned to my girlfriend today that I could probably write about a typical day in my life. She said
writing about a day in a life of a software engineer is pretty popular nowadays, so I figured why not?

So here it is.

# A day in the life of me (June 2019)

**08:00:** My morning alarm sounds. There's a 50% chance that I'll sleep through this. The other 50% of the time, I
turn it off and go back to sleep.

**08:10:** My 2nd morning alarm sounds. There's a 50% chance I'll sleep through this. The other 50% of the time, I'll
actually get up.

**08:20:** My 3rd morning alarm sounds. By this time I would be awake and getting dressed for work. Once or twice, I
might end up sleeping through this and miss my shuttle to work. If this happens, I end up waiting for the next
shuttle that comes at 09:20.

**08:30:** Head out to my shuttle bus stop. One bad thing about the Bay Area is the lack of public transport outside
of the San Francisco city limit. To prevent literal tens of thousands of cars converging into one tiny area, many
large tech companies contract and operate their own transport network of shuttle buses to take their employees to and from
work. Facebook is one of these companies.

**08:45:** Board the bus to work. During the trip, I could be scrolling through Facebook and Reddit, going through
Japanese flashcards or just catching up on sleep.

**09:20-09:55:** Arrive at Facebook, building 20 (MPK 20). The exact time depends on how bad the traffic is (remember how I said
public transport isn't great here?). Most of the time, I arrive before 09:40.

**09:30-10:15:** Have breakfast around this time, depending on my arrival time. 
The building I work in has two big cafeterias and two cafés to choose from. The food in the cafeterias are usually 
baked potatoes or tater tots, with spinach, bacon and scrambled eggs with a variety of drinks.
The bigger cafeteria also has congee and fruit. The cafés just have pastries like croissants, but they have much
better coffee (but you also have to pay for said coffee).

**10:20:** By this time, I'll be at my desk and working. The first half hour is usually checking on the status of my diffs 
(also known as pull requests) and see whether they're approved by my team or it needs more work. If it's
approved, I would usually begin the process of merging it into the master branch.

**11:00-12:30:** If a team meeting is scheduled, they'll probably happen around this time. If not, I work on whatever
task or project that I've picked up.

**12:30:** Lunch time! Nomnomnomnomnom.

![Yum][lunch]

**13:00:** After lunch, I like to take a walk on the roof to ward off the food coma. My building is unique in that it's about 
1.5 kilometres long and has a garden on the roof.

![Believe it or not, this is actually the roof of a building.][rooftop]

**13:30:** Back to work.

**15:00:** Around this time, I take a short break and find something to snack on in the microkitchen, then spend 30-60 minutes
reviewing peoples' code.

**17:00:** Start wrapping up my work for the day. This might mean committing my work to source control so I can work on it
later, doing my final checks before I check in code for review, or checking my existing diffs to see if it's been
approved or needs more work. If it's approved, I usually wait until the next day to merge it so I'll be around in case
the code breaks Facebook.

**17:30:** Head to the shuttle stop and take the bus home, or head to the company gym and work out for an hour.

![Home time][hometime]

**18:30:** Around this time I've either arrived at home and started making dinner, or eating dinner at work 
after leaving the gym. 

**19:30:** Wash the dishes and clean the house/Take the shuttle home from work.

**20:30:** Shower.

**21:00:** Free time! I could be reading, gaming, chatting with friends online, watching a show or catching up
with my girlfriend. 

**23:45:** Finish up whatever I'm doing and get ready for bed. 

**00:15 (next day):** Zzzzzzzzzzz...
