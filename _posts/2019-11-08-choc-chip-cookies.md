I recently made choc chip cookies so I could send snacks to my girlfriend. They arrived a few days ago and this is what she had to say about it:

> Tastes wholesome. They sweeten up my soul.

I'm gonna assume that means my cookies are girlfriend approved. So here's the recipe I used in case anyone wants to make some wholesome,
soul sweetening cookies!

# Choc Chip Cookies

Based on the recipe from [Betty Crocker](https://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes/ultimate-chocolate-chip-cookies/77c14e03-d8b0-4844-846d-f19304f61c57).

I followed most of the ingredients and methods from the recipe, with
two important adjustments:
- I used 33% less sugar, as the original recipe was overkill on this
- I added 62.5% less chocolate chips. Even one full cup was too much.

# Equipment
- A large mixing bowl
- A medium mixing bowl
- Baking pan
- Baking paper
- Measuring spoon set
- Measuring cup set
- An oven
- A whisk or a sturdy spoon

# Ingredients
- 2.25 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup (or 2 sticks) of butter
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1/2 cup light brown sugar
- 1 egg
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 3/4 cups semisweet mini chocolate chips ([Example](https://www.amazon.com/Enjoy-Life-Semi-Sweet-Dairy-Chocolate/dp/B000HDJZWO))

# Method
1. Preheat oven to 375F (~191C)
2. Mix flour, baking soda and salt together in a bowl
3. Soften your butter if it's not. I just threw it in a microwave until it's half melted (45 seconds should do it)
4. Beat the softened butter with your sugars with a spoon until it's fluffy. Then mix it with the flour
5. Beat the egg into the rest of the mix, and add the vanilla extract. Mix until it's clumpy and sticky.
6. Add in chocolate chips and mix again until it's evenly distributed.
7. Place baking paper on the baking pan, then put cookie dough on the pan in small clumps, separated
   2 inches (~5cm) apart. For consistency, consider using a tablespoon to scoop your cookie dough
8. Bake 8-10 minutes until the cookies are light brown. Centres will be soft. If your oven isn't fan-forced, you
may have to bake for around 15 minutes instead. Monitor constantly after the 10 minute mark.
9. Remove cookies from the oven and leave it to cool on the pan for about 2 minutes. Move the cookies to a
   plate or cooling rack afterwards and leave it to cool for another 30 minutes. Store the cookies in an airtight
   container
