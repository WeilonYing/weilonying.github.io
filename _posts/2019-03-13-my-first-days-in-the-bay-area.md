# Goodbye Sydney
It feels wrong for me to talk about my first few days in the San Francisco Bay Area without saying goodbye to the place
where I've grown up all my life. Near the end of March in 2018, I signed a full-time employment
contract with Facebook in Menlo Park. This was possibly the best start to my professional career
I could ever get, and it was only natural that I took this chance by the horns.

Just under a year later, I said my farewells to my friends and family who've supported me throughout
my life journey on the 2nd March. And only a day later, I was jetting to the States on a Boeing 747.
