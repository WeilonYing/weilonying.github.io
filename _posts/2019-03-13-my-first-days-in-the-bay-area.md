# Goodbye Sydney
It feels wrong for me to talk about my first few days in the San Francisco Bay Area without saying goodbye to the place
where I've grown up all my life. Near the end of March in 2018, I signed a full-time employment
contract with Facebook in Menlo Park. This was possibly the best start to my professional career
I could ever get, and it was only natural that I took this chance by the horns.

Just under a year later, I said my farewells to my friends and family who've supported me
throughout my life journey on the 2nd March. And only a day later, I was jetting to the States on a Boeing 747.

# Time travelling
One interesting thing about flying from Sydney to San Francisco is that you travel back in time!
Sort of.

Because the International Date Line lies in the Pacific Ocean between Sydney and San Francisco,
Sydney is actually 18 hours ahead of San Francisco as of this time of writing (daylight savings is
a thing in both cities). As a result, I left on **Sunday 3rd March 5:55pm in Sydney** and arrived on
**Sunday 3rd March 12:00pm** in San Francisco. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get a picture of
the city since I was allocated a seat smack bang in the middle of the plane, but here's a picture
of Facebook HQ from my previous internship there in the summer (or winter for you northern
hemisphere dwellers).

# Exploring the Bay Area
My parents decided to come along with me for my first month in the States, so I naturally had to
show them around the Bay Area before I started work in the following week.
