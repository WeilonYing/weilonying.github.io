Hello! My name is Weilon. I am a UNSW graduate with a double degree in Bachelor of Science (Computer Science)
and Bachelor of Commerce (Information Systems). I started in 2015, and graduated at the end of 2018.

As a follow up to my Computer Science course reviews,
I figured I might as well give my opinion on the
courses I've done for my Commerce degree as well.

### ECON1101
**Microeconomics 1**
